# Godwin_Boards

'''
This is my first major web application
It is a board built using django 

I followed the django tutorial on https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/beginners-guide/1.11/
The source code can be found on https://github.com/sibtc/django-beginners-guide

I typed in every single code myself instead of just cloning or copying and pasting
I rewrote some parts like boards/url.py to reflect recent changes in upgraded software versions

I also made some modification
  I added a new board feature (In the tutorial, new boards were created using api by admins only)
  I implemented the DeleteView for the posts (No delete feature in the tutorial)
  I pinned the first post on the replyview and topicpostviews for all pages
