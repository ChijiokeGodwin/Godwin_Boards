Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
Follow this link: {{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}.

In case you forgot your Godwin Boards username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the url in a new window browser instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you did not initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely disregard this email.

Thanks,
The Godwin Boards Team.
